## 1. Formalization of Algorithm concept
**Algorithm**
> An algo is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output

**Instance**
> An instance of a problems a.k.a as the Input of a problem

**Efficiency (Complexity)**
+ Space Complexity (Auxiliary Space): it relies on the Data Structures used
+ Computational Complexity: relies on the amount of steps
	+ Mejor Caso, Peor Caso y Caso Promedio

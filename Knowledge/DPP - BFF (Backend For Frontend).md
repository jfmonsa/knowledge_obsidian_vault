+ you can create endpoints for specific screens or features, hiding de complexity for client
+ The BFF can benefit from hiding unnecessary or sensitive data before transferring it to the frontend application interface, so keys and tokens for 3rd party services can be stored and used from BFF.
+ Apply data transformation (adapters layer) in the BFF simplifying client logic
+ Give us possibilities to develop specific server logic for each type of client, for example queue for notifications on mobile apps client
## Tips

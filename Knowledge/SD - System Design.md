+ Is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.
System design in Software Engineering (SE) involves:

- **High-level Architecture**: Defining the overall structure and components of a system.
- **Component Interaction**: Determining how different parts of the system will interact with each other.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the system can handle growth in users, data, and transactions.
- **Performance**: Optimizing the system for speed and efficiency.
- **Reliability**: Designing the system to be fault-tolerant and dependable.
- **Security**: Implementing measures to protect the system from unauthorized access and attacks.
- **Maintainability**: Making the system easy to update and improve over time.
- **Technology Stack**: Choosing the appropriate technologies and tools for implementation.
- **Data Management**: Planning how data will be stored, accessed, and managed.
- **User Requirements**: Ensuring the system meets the needs and expectations of its users.

# Concepts
+ Monorepo vs multi-repo
+ Monolith vs Microservices
+ Web API architecture patterns: SOAP, REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebHook, WebSockets
# Notes
## Web API architecture patterns
+ [[SD - API REST]]: What is, parts of http requests, resource, representation, constraints (stateless), api versioning
	+ [[SD SEE (Server Sent Events)]] Technique for periodic updates from server
+ [[SD - GraphQL]]: intro
+ [[SD - WebSockets]]: Intro, javascript libraries to implement WebSockets, Socke.io: rooms and namespaces

# Websockets
+ standard that describes a way for clients and servers to exchange messages in **realtime**
+ provides **bi-directional communication** between server and client with the usage of a single long-lasting [TCP connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)
+ Layer 7 (OSI)
+ not protected by same-origin policy
+ Client and server **listen** and emit **events** to comunicate
+ Implemented on top of **http**
## Javascript
+ **ws** - a node package to emulate the WebSocket support for browsers but for node and usually used as a server (though it can do both)
+ **Socket.IO** - is a library (built on top of WebSocket protocol), (must be used both on client and server). ==Recommended==
---
Other:
+ **Socket** - is an endpoint (in a socket communication)

### Socket IO
+ You need to use it in browser and server
+ You have to set CORS since its a custom protocol built on top of WebSockets protocol
---
+ Rooms and namespaces are created on the server side

### Rooms
![[Pasted image 20241009081437.png]]
+ is an arbitrary channel that sockets can `join` and `leave`. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients
+ By default socket.io joins you to a room with your `socket.id`
+ It's quite useful using rooms instead you implementing your own mechanism e.g. throught HashMaps
+ When a socket disconnects the socket leave all rooms in the server automatically 
### namespaces

+ A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called "multiplexing")
+ Possible use-cases
	+ you want to create a special namespace that only authorized users have access to, so the logic related to those users is separated from the rest of the application
	+ your application has multiple tenants so you want to dynamically create one namespace per tenant

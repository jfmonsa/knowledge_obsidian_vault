## 5. Recursion Intro
+ A method that calls itself as a subroutine until a base case is reached
+  each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems
+ The recursion call continues until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.
+ A basic recursive function has two cases: **base case** and **recursive case (recurrence relation)**

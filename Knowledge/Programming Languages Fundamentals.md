# Programming Paradigm

+ **Imperative Programming**: Focuses on describing the steps to reach a desired state in the program
+ **Declarative Programming**: Emphasis is on describing what the program should acomplish without specifying how
+ **Functional Programming**: Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
+ **Object Oriented Programming**: focuses on representing concepts as “objects” that have data (attributes) and methods (functions) associated with them. It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
+ **Procedural Programming**:  Involves writing code in a step-by-step manner, breaking down tasks into a series of procedures or functions. It’s often used for tasks that involve a sequence of steps.
+ **Event-Driven Programming**: Resolves around responding to events triggered by the user or the system
+ **Logic Programming**: you define a set of facts and rules, and the program derives new facts from the existing ones using logical inference. (e.g. Prolog)

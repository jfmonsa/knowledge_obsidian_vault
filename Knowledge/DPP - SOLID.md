## Single Responsability Principle (SRP)
a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. This promotes focused, cohesive units of code.

### Concerns
+ A class can have multiple methods, as long as they collectively serve a single responsibility
### Problems when SRP violation
+ **Tight Coupling**: functionalities are intertwined, making changes to one aspect likely to ripple through the entire service
+ **Reduced Testability**: Writing comprehensive unit tests for this monolith becomes incredibly complicated. You’d need to mock or set up the database, cache, mailer, etc., even for simple authentication logic tests.
+ **Poor Maintainability:** Understanding this super-service requires keeping a vast array of concerns in your head at once.
## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This means your code can be easily extended with new functionalities without having to rewrite existing logic
+ SRP plays a crucial role here, as loosely coupled, well-defined services become easier to extend.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
> Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the program’s correctness

SRP helps ensure that your services have clear responsibilities, making it more likely that subclasses can safely inherit their behavior.

This principle states that objects of a parent’s class should be replaceable with objects of the child’s class without breaking the logic of the application. That requires the objects of your child’s class to behave in the same way as the objects of your parent’s class.
## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

Clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they don’t use. SRP aligns well with ISP, as it encourages focused services with well-defined interfaces. Clients only interact with the functionalities they need.


## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP
> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces). SRP promotes loosely coupled services, making it easier to implement abstractions and adhere to DIP.
